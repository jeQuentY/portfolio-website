          Hello, I'm Alex, also known as Quenty. I'm a 17-year-old photographer
          from Romania who discovered my passion for photography at the age of
          7, using an old camera. Over the years, I have devoted myself to
          improving my skills and refining my art, capturing stunning and
          meaningful images that reflect my unique perspective and creative
          vision. As a young photographer, my future is full of promise, and my
          unwavering commitment to my craft is sure to take me far in my career.
